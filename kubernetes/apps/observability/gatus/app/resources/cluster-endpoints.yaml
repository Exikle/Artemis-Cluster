# Auto-discovery file for gatus-sidecar
# The sidecar will dynamically populate this with HTTPRoutes/Services
# You can also manually add critical cluster endpoints here

# Example manual endpoints (uncomment to use):
# endpoints:
#   - name: kube-apiserver
#     group: infrastructure
#     url: "https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/readyz"
#     interval: 30s
#     client:
#       insecure: true
#     conditions:
#       - "[STATUS] == 200"
